# Project Context: imajin-cli

## üåü **Democratic Revolution in API Integration**

**Build the free, open-source alternative to expensive middleware platforms that democratizes professional API integration for everyone.**

Instead of paying monthly fees for vendor-controlled API platforms, generate **professional CLI tools that you own forever** - with enterprise-grade patterns, universal graph translation, and perfect LLM integration.

**The Problem We're Solving:**

```bash
# Today: Expensive middleware hell
$99/month for API platform subscription
vendor-controlled access and pricing
complex middleware that breaks when you need it most
generic wrappers that don't understand your business

# Tomorrow: Democratic professional tooling
imajin generate stripe --spec openapi.json
# Result: Enterprise-grade CLI tools you own forever
# No subscriptions, no vendor lock-in, no middleware complexity
```

## üéØ **Core Mission: Economic Democracy for Developers**

**Break free from vendor lock-in and subscription fatigue.**

### **What We're NOT Building:**

- ‚ùå Another subscription-based API platform
- ‚ùå Vendor-controlled middleware layer
- ‚ùå Generic API wrappers that cost money monthly
- ‚ùå Complex MCP servers that require hosting

### **What We ARE Building:**

- ‚úÖ **Free CLI generation engine** that you own forever
- ‚úÖ **Professional enterprise patterns** without enterprise pricing
- ‚úÖ **Universal graph translation** for efficient user-to-user communication
- ‚úÖ **Democratic access** to tooling typically locked behind expensive contracts
- ‚úÖ **Direct LLM integration** without middleware complexity

## üèóÔ∏è **Revolutionary Architecture**

### **1. Universal Elements Foundation**

**The breakthrough insight:** Everything in business can be mapped to universal elements.

```typescript
// Universal business objects that ALL services map to
Customer, Payment, Event, Product, Service, Order, Invoice;
Contact, Organization, Location, Media, Document, Transaction;
```

**Benefits:**

- **Cross-service compatibility** - Stripe customers map to Salesforce contacts
- **Type safety everywhere** - Compile-time validation across all integrations
- **LLM understanding** - AI can work with consistent business concepts
- **Community standards** - Shared schemas that evolve together

### **2. Graph Translation Engine**

**The efficiency breakthrough:** Users choose standard graph models for maximum compatibility.

```typescript
// Standard graph models for different use cases
SocialCommerceGraph; // Products, events, connections, transactions
CreativePortfolioGraph; // Artworks, exhibitions, commissions, availability
ProfessionalNetwork; // Experience, skills, connections, recommendations
CommunityHubGraph; // Groups, discussions, events, resources
```

**Communication Matrix:**

- **Same model = Direct communication** (no ETL needed)
- **Different models = Intelligent translation** (optimized ETL bridges)
- **Custom models = Context normalization** (translate to user's chosen context)

### **3. Enterprise-Grade CLI Generation**

**The quality breakthrough:** Every generated CLI includes patterns that usually cost thousands.

```bash
# Generated CLIs include enterprise capabilities
stripe customer:create --name "Jane" --email "jane@co.com" --json
# ‚úÖ Secure credential management (Keychain/Windows Credential Manager)
# ‚úÖ Rate limiting and circuit breakers
# ‚úÖ Structured error handling with recovery strategies
# ‚úÖ Real-time progress tracking via events
# ‚úÖ Background job processing for long operations
# ‚úÖ Comprehensive audit logging
# ‚úÖ Health monitoring and diagnostics
```

### **4. Perfect LLM Integration (No Middleware)**

**The AI breakthrough:** Direct CLI execution beats complex middleware layers.

```bash
# AI agents execute CLIs directly - simple and reliable
my-stripe-cli customer:create --name "John" --json
my-notion-cli page:create --title "New Customer: John" --json
my-github-cli issue:create --title "Follow up with John" --json

# No MCP servers, no subscription fees, no hosting complexity
# Just reliable CLI tools with JSON-native output
```

## üîß **Three-Tier Technical Architecture**

### **Tier 1: Service Ecosystem**

Traditional API service integration:

```

```

### **Tier 2: Graph Translation Layer**

User-to-user communication and networking:

```
User Graph A ‚Üí Graph Translator ‚Üí User Graph B (same/different models)
```

### **Tier 3: Universal Elements Core**

Foundational business concepts everything maps to:

```
Universal Customer, Payment, Event, Product ‚Üí Type-safe operations everywhere
```
