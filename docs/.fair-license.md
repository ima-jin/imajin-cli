# .fair LICENSING AGREEMENT

## Universal Creative Asset Attribution and Economic Framework

### Core Principles

This project operates under the **.fair protocol** - ensuring transparent attribution, sustainable revenue sharing, and community-driven development for **any creative asset or intellectual contribution**.

The .fair protocol applies to all forms of creative work including:
- **Code & Software**: Functions, modules, libraries, applications, CLI tools
- **Documents & Content**: Documentation, guides, templates, specifications
- **Visual Assets**: Images, diagrams, designs, interfaces, artwork
- **Data & Knowledge**: Datasets, configurations, patterns, methodologies
- **Services & Infrastructure**: APIs, workflows, architectures, deployment patterns

### Attribution Chain

All contributions, improvements, and usage of creative assets must maintain a clear attribution chain:

```yaml
original_creator: "Asset creator or project name"
asset_type: "code|document|image|data|service|other"
project_maintainers:
  - primary: "Primary creator and core contributors"
  - community: "Community contributors and improvers"
license_type: ".fair economic attribution"
created_date: "Asset creation date"
last_modified: "Most recent contribution date"
```

### Revenue Sharing Framework

#### 1. Core Asset Revenue (Primary creation and platform)

```yaml
revenue_split:
  asset_development: 60% # Primary creator and core development
  infrastructure: 20% # Hosting, distribution, operational costs
  community_fund: 15% # Contributor rewards and community initiatives
  ecosystem_fund: 5% # Supporting related creative works and tools
```

#### 2. Derived Asset Revenue (Works based on or incorporating original assets)

```yaml
revenue_split:
  original_asset: 40% # Revenue share to original creative work
  derivative_creator: 35% # Creator of the derived work
  improvement_contributors: 15% # Contributors who enhanced the asset
  platform_service: 10% # Distribution and attribution platform
```

#### 3. Service Revenue (Platforms and tools using creative assets)

```yaml
revenue_split:
  service_platform: 70% # Service development and operation
  integrated_assets: 20% # Revenue share to assets being utilized
  community_improvements: 10% # Contributors to service enhancements
```

### Contribution Attribution

All contributions to creative assets are tracked and attributed across all asset types:

#### Creative Contributions

- **Original creation** → Primary attribution and revenue share
- **Improvements and enhancements** → Proportional revenue share based on impact
- **Documentation and examples** → Community fund allocation
- **Bug fixes and optimizations** → Contributor reward pool
- **Integration and adaptation** → Derivative work attribution

#### Knowledge Contributions

- **Methodologies and patterns** → Attribution in works using patterns
- **Best practices and insights** → Share in ecosystem revenue
- **Testing and validation** → Quality assurance contributor status
- **Educational content** → Knowledge sharing contributor recognition

### Asset Licensing and Embedding

Each creative asset carries embedded attribution metadata:

```yaml
# .fair-attribution.yml (embedded in every creative asset)
asset_name: "{asset_name}"
asset_type: "{code|document|image|data|service|other}"
created_by: "{creator} via {platform/tool}"
creation_date: "{timestamp}"
source_inspiration: "{original_sources_or_influences}"
contributors:
  - contributor_id: "{id}"
    contribution_type: "{improvement|adaptation|enhancement|documentation}"
    contribution_weight: "{percentage}"
    contribution_date: "{timestamp}"

usage_tracking:
  usage_fee: "{per_use_or_subscription_fee}"
  billing_frequency: "{monthly|per_use|subscription}"
  usage_tracking_enabled: true
  revenue_splits:
    creator: "{percentage}"
    contributors: "{percentage}"
    platform: "{percentage}"
```

### Usage Rights and Creative Freedom

#### Open Creative Foundation

- **Source assets**: Open license with .fair attribution requirements
- **Derived works**: .fair economic attribution with usage tracking
- **Documentation and guides**: Creative Commons with attribution
- **Templates and patterns**: Open use with contribution tracking

#### Commercial Usage

- **Personal and internal use**: Free with attribution maintained
- **Commercial distribution**: Revenue sharing applies
- **White-label or rebranding**: Enterprise licensing required
- **Cost pass-through**: Customer responsibility for third-party services

#### Attribution Requirements

All users must:

1. **Maintain attribution chain** in all derived works
2. **Report usage metrics** for fair revenue distribution
3. **Contribute improvements** back to community assets
4. **Respect original creator intent** and license terms
5. **Document adaptations** and modifications transparently

### Economic Protocol Implementation

#### Revenue Tracking

```yaml
tracking_mechanisms:
  usage_metrics: "Asset utilization counting with metadata"
  creation_impact: "Measurement of creative contribution value"
  revenue_attribution: "Cryptographic proof of contribution"
  payment_processing: "Smart contract or traditional payment rails"
  dispute_resolution: "Community governance and arbitration"
```

#### Payment Distribution

- **Regular revenue distribution** based on tracked usage and impact
- **Transparent reporting** of all revenue and distributions
- **Creator dashboard** showing earnings, usage, and attribution
- **Community governance** for fair distribution algorithms

#### Impact Measurement

- **Creative impact**: Measuring how much an asset influences other works
- **Usage frequency**: Tracking adoption and utilization patterns
- **Community value**: Assessing contribution to ecosystem health
- **Quality metrics**: Evaluating asset effectiveness and satisfaction

### Community Governance

#### Decision Making

- **Asset development**: Creator autonomy with community feedback
- **Revenue distribution**: Algorithm-based with transparent community oversight
- **Dispute resolution**: Community arbitration with creator rights protection
- **Ecosystem direction**: Stakeholder voting weighted by creative contribution

#### Creator Rights

- **Attribution guarantee**: Permanent attribution for all creative contributions
- **Revenue sharing**: Fair share based on creation impact and usage
- **Creative control**: Maintaining creator intent and quality standards
- **Improvement incentives**: Economic rewards for ecosystem enhancement

### Legal Framework

#### Jurisdiction and Enforcement

- **Governing law**: [Jurisdiction based on asset creator or primary platform location]
- **Dispute resolution**: Community mediation first, arbitration as fallback
- **Contract validity**: .fair protocol recognition required for participation
- **Intellectual property**: Creators retain rights, grant usage license with attribution

#### Liability and Warranty

- **Creative assets**: Provided with attribution accuracy guarantee
- **Platform reliability**: Best effort maintenance with transparent SLA
- **Data privacy**: Usage tracking limited to attribution and fair compensation
- **Security**: Standard security practices with community vulnerability reporting

### Asset Types and Applications
