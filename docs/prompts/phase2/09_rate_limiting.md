# üö¶ IMPLEMENT: Rate Limiting & API Management

**Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING**  
**Phase:** 2 - Infrastructure Components  
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours  
**Dependencies:** Service Providers, Exception System  

---

## CONTEXT
Create sophisticated rate limiting and API management capabilities that respect service limits, prevent abuse, and ensure reliable operation across all integrated services.

## ARCHITECTURAL VISION
Professional API management:
- Per-service rate limiting with different strategies
- Request queuing and throttling
- Circuit breaker patterns for API failures
- Connection pooling and management
- API health monitoring and fallback strategies

## DELIVERABLES
1. `src/core/ratelimit/RateLimiter.ts` - Core rate limiting
2. `src/core/ratelimit/strategies/` - Different limiting strategies
3. `src/core/api/ApiManager.ts` - API connection management
4. `src/core/api/CircuitBreaker.ts` - Circuit breaker implementation
5. Integration with all service connectors

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Rate Limiting Strategies
```typescript
interface RateLimitStrategy {
  readonly name: string;
  canMakeRequest(serviceId: string): boolean;
  recordRequest(serviceId: string): void;
  getWaitTime(serviceId: string): number;
  getStatus(serviceId: string): RateLimitStatus;
}

// Implementations: TokenBucket, SlidingWindow, FixedWindow
```

### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Automatic failure detection
- Service degradation modes
- Recovery testing and restoration
- Fallback strategy execution

### 3. API Health Management
- Connection pooling and reuse
- Health check scheduling
- Automatic reconnection logic
- Performance metrics collection

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] No API rate limit violations across all services
- [ ] Graceful handling of API outages and failures
- [ ] Automatic recovery from transient issues
- [ ] Performance optimization through connection pooling

## NEXT STEP
After completion, update `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md`:
- Move this task from "In Progress" to "Completed"
- Set **Prompt 10: Media Processing System** to "In Progress"
