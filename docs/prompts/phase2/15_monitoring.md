# üìä IMPLEMENT: Monitoring & Diagnostics

**Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING**  
**Phase:** 2 - Infrastructure Components  
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours  
**Dependencies:** Service Layer, Background Jobs, Event System  

---

## CONTEXT
Create comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics capabilities for system health, performance tracking, and operational insights. Enhanced with patterns from enterprise systems.

## ARCHITECTURAL VISION
Production-ready monitoring:
- Real-time system health monitoring
- Performance metrics collection and analysis
- Automated alerting and notifications
- Diagnostic tools for troubleshooting
- Integration with external monitoring services

## DELIVERABLES
1. `src/diagnostics/HealthCheck.ts` - System health monitoring
2. `src/diagnostics/MetricsCollector.ts` - Performance metrics
3. `src/diagnostics/SystemMonitor.ts` - Overall system monitoring
4. `src/diagnostics/BulkOperationMonitor.ts` - High-volume operation tracking
5. Integration with all other components

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Health Check System
```typescript
interface HealthCheck {
  name: string;
  check(): Promise<HealthStatus>;
  timeout?: number;
  critical?: boolean;
}

interface HealthStatus {
  status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unhealthy';
  details?: any;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### 2. Metrics Collection
- Performance counters and timers
- Memory and CPU usage tracking
- API response time monitoring
- Custom business metrics

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] System health can be monitored and reported
- [ ] Performance metrics are collected
- [ ] Bulk operations are tracked and optimized
- [ ] Diagnostic information is available for troubleshooting
- [ ] LLM can query system status
