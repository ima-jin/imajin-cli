# üîó IMPLEMENT: Webhooks & HTTP Layer

**Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING**  
**Phase:** 2 - Infrastructure Components  
**Estimated Time:** 10-12 hours  
**Dependencies:** Service Providers, Event System, Exception System  

---

## CONTEXT
Create a robust HTTP layer that can receive webhooks from external services, manage HTTP servers for real-time communication, and provide HTTP utilities for all system components.

## ARCHITECTURAL VISION
Production-ready HTTP infrastructure:
- Webhook receiver server for external integrations
- HTTP utilities for outbound requests
- Request/response middleware pipeline
- Security features (signature validation, CORS)
- Integration with event system for webhook processing

## DELIVERABLES
1. `src/http/WebhookServer.ts` - Webhook receiving server
2. `src/http/HttpClient.ts` - Enhanced HTTP client
3. `src/http/middleware/` - Request/response middleware
4. `src/http/security/` - Security utilities
5. `src/commands/webhook/` - Webhook management commands

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Webhook Server
```typescript
interface WebhookServer {
  start(port: number): Promise<void>;
  registerHandler(path: string, handler: WebhookHandler): void;
  validateSignature(payload: string, signature: string, secret: string): boolean;
  processWebhook(request: WebhookRequest): Promise<WebhookResponse>;
}
```

### 2. HTTP Client Enhancement
- Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff
- Request/response interceptors
- Automatic error handling and logging
- Integration with rate limiting system

### 3. Security Features
- Webhook signature validation
- IP whitelist/blacklist support
- CORS configuration
- Request size limits

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Can receive and process webhooks from external services
- [ ] HTTP client provides reliable outbound communication
- [ ] Security features prevent abuse and unauthorized access
- [ ] Integration with event system enables webhook-driven workflows

## NEXT STEP
After completion, update `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md`:
- Move this task from "In Progress" to "Completed"
- Set **Prompt 12: Service Layer** to "In Progress"
