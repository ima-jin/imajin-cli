# üîó IMPLEMENT: Webhooks & HTTP Layer

**Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING**  
**Phase:** 2 - Infrastructure Components  
**Estimated Time:** 10-12 hours  
**Dependencies:** Service Providers, Event System, Exception System  

---

## CONTEXT
Create a robust HTTP layer that can receive webhooks from external services, manage HTTP servers for real-time communication, and provide HTTP utilities for all system components.

## ARCHITECTURAL VISION
Production-ready HTTP infrastructure:
- Webhook receiver server for external integrations
- HTTP utilities for outbound requests
- Request/response middleware pipeline
- Security features (signature validation, CORS)
- Integration with event system for webhook processing

## üßπ **CLEANUP PHASE - BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION**

**CRITICAL: Address foundation issues before adding HTTP infrastructure:**

### **Fix Compilation Errors:**
1. **BaseException.from() method** - Already fixed in BaseException.ts
2. **SystemErrorType missing values** - Already fixed in SystemError.ts  
3. **ETL timing bug** - Already fixed in BaseExtractor.ts
4. **Verify project builds:** Ensure `npm run build` succeeds before proceeding

### **Remove Stubs & TODOs:**
1. Fix TODO items in `src/generators/templates/simple.template.ts:81,90`
2. Remove placeholder logging code in `src/core/ErrorHandler.ts:180`
3. Clean up any placeholder HTTP client implementations in ETL extractors

### **Service Provider Consistency:**
1. **Add missing interface method:** Add `registerCommands?(program: Command): void` to base ServiceProvider
2. **Standardize HTTP patterns:** Ensure consistent HTTP client usage across components
3. **Fix integration points:** Verify event system integration works properly

### **Clean Up Existing Webhook Code:**
1. Review existing WebhookManager.ts for consistency
2. Remove any duplicate HTTP client configurations
3. Ensure event system properly handles webhook events

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:** Project must compile successfully and existing HTTP/webhook code must be clean.

## DELIVERABLES
1. `src/http/WebhookServer.ts` - Webhook receiving server
2. `src/http/HttpClient.ts` - Enhanced HTTP client
3. `src/http/middleware/` - Request/response middleware
4. `src/http/security/` - Security utilities
5. `src/commands/webhook/` - Webhook management commands

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Webhook Server
```typescript
interface WebhookServer {
  start(port: number): Promise<void>;
  registerHandler(path: string, handler: WebhookHandler): void;
  validateSignature(payload: string, signature: string, secret: string): boolean;
  processWebhook(request: WebhookRequest): Promise<WebhookResponse>;
}
```

### 2. HTTP Client Enhancement
- Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff
- Request/response interceptors
- Automatic error handling and logging
- Integration with rate limiting system

### 3. Security Features
- Webhook signature validation
- IP whitelist/blacklist support
- CORS configuration
- Request size limits

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Can receive and process webhooks from external services
- [ ] HTTP client provides reliable outbound communication
- [ ] Security features prevent abuse and unauthorized access
- [ ] Integration with event system enables webhook-driven workflows
