# üè¢ IMPLEMENT: Service Layer

**Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING**  
**Phase:** 2 - Infrastructure Components  
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours  
**Dependencies:** Service Providers, Exception System  

---

## CONTEXT
Create a comprehensive service layer architecture that provides business logic encapsulation, dependency management, and integration capabilities.

## üßπ **CLEANUP PHASE - BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION**

**CRITICAL: Clean up service provider inconsistencies first:**

### **Service Provider Pattern Fixes:**
1. **Add missing interface method:** Add `registerCommands?(program: Command): void` to base ServiceProvider
2. **Fix integration points:** Ensure Application.ts properly handles optional methods
3. **Standardize patterns:** Make all providers follow consistent registration patterns

### **Clean Up Existing Services:**
1. Remove placeholder implementations in StripeServiceProvider
2. Fix credential service provider references that don't exist
3. Ensure HTTP client configurations are consistent across services

### **Resolve Integration Issues:**
1. Fix service discovery and registration flow
2. Clean up circular dependency concerns
3. Standardize error handling across all services

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:** All existing services work properly before adding new service layer.

## DELIVERABLES
1. `src/services/BaseService.ts` - Base service abstraction
2. `src/services/interfaces/` - Service interfaces and contracts
3. `src/services/ServiceRegistry.ts` - Service discovery and management
4. Factory and Strategy pattern implementations
5. Integration with ETL Pipeline and Event System

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Services can be registered, discovered, and injected
- [ ] Factory and Strategy patterns enable flexible object creation
- [ ] Clean business logic encapsulation
- [ ] Ready for connector integrations
