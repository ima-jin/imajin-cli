# 📊 IMPLEMENT: Enhanced ETL Pipeline System with Graph Translation

**Status:** ⏳ **PENDING**  
**Phase:** 2 - Infrastructure Components  
**Estimated Time:** 12-15 hours  
**Dependencies:** Service Providers, Type System, Event System, Plugin System  

---

## CONTEXT
Create a modern TypeScript ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) architecture for imajin-cli that enables:
1. **Traditional data processing** workflows and service integrations
2. **Graph-to-Graph translation** between different graph models
3. **Context normalization** where users can translate any external graph into their chosen model
4. **Universal communication** between nodes using standard models
5. **AI-composable** operations through clear CLI interfaces
6. **Human-readable** configuration and output formats

## ARCHITECTURAL VISION
**Dual-Purpose ETL System:**
- **Service ETL**: Traditional API service data transformations
- **Graph ETL**: Translation between graph models
- **Context ETL**: Normalize external graphs to user's context
- **Bridge ETL**: Simple, composable bridges between models

## DELIVERABLES
1. `src/etl/core/` - ETL base abstractions
2. `src/etl/extractors/` - Data extraction components
3. `src/etl/transformers/` - Data transformation logic
4. `src/etl/loaders/` - Data loading components
5. `src/etl/Pipeline.ts` - ETL orchestration system
6. `src/etl/graphs/` - Graph model definitions
7. `src/etl/bridges/` - Bridge system
8. CLI commands for ETL operations

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. CLI Command Structure
```typescript
// Bridge Management Commands
class BridgeCommand extends BaseCommand {
    async execute() {
        // List available bridges
        // Show bridge details
        // Create new bridge
    }
}

// Graph Translation Commands
class TranslateCommand extends BaseCommand {
    async execute() {
        // Translate between graph models
        // Show translation options
        // Configure translation
    }
}
```

### 2. Human-Readable Configuration Format
```yaml
# bridge-config.yaml
source: social-commerce
target: creative-portfolio
mappings:
  catalog.products: portfolio.artworks
  catalog.services: professional.commissions
  catalog.events: portfolio.exhibitions
transformations:
  products-to-artworks:
    source: catalog.products
    target: portfolio.artworks
    rules:
      - name: title
        from: name
      - name: description
        from: description
      - name: medium
        from: category
```

### 3. CLI Help Text Examples
```bash
# List available bridges
$ imajin bridge list
Available Bridges:
  social-commerce -> creative-portfolio
  creative-portfolio -> professional-network
  ...

# Show bridge details
$ imajin bridge show social-commerce-to-creative-portfolio
Bridge: social-commerce-to-creative-portfolio
Source: social-commerce
Target: creative-portfolio
Mappings:
  catalog.products -> portfolio.artworks
  catalog.services -> professional.commissions
  ...

# Create new bridge
$ imajin bridge create
? Source model: social-commerce
? Target model: creative-portfolio
? Add field mapping: catalog.products -> portfolio.artworks
? Add another mapping? (y/n)
```

### 4. Bridge Definition
```typescript
interface Bridge {
    source: string;
    target: string;
    mappings: Record<string, string>;
    transformations?: {
        [key: string]: {
            source: string;
            target: string;
            rules: Array<{
                name: string;
                from: string;
            }>;
        };
    };
}
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] **CLI Interface**: Clear, intuitive commands for ETL operations
- [ ] **AI Composable**: Help text enables AI to understand and compose operations
- [ ] **Human Readable**: Configuration and output are easy to understand
- [ ] **Graph Translation**: Can translate between different graph models
- [ ] **Direct Communication**: Same-model graphs communicate without ETL
- [ ] **Context Normalization**: External graphs can be normalized to user's context
- [ ] **Real-time Capable**: Graph translations can happen in real-time

## INTEGRATION POINTS
- CLI: Clear command structure and help text
- Configuration: Human-readable YAML/JSON format
- Plugin System: Bridge definitions as plugins
- Event System: Bridge operations emit events
- Type System: Basic type safety without over-constraining

## NEXT STEP
After completion, update `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md`:
- Move this task from "In Progress" to "Completed"
- Set **Prompt 8: Exception System & Error Handling** to "In Progress"
