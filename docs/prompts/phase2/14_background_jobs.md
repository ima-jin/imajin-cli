# ‚öôÔ∏è IMPLEMENT: Background Job Processing

**Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING**  
**Phase:** 2 - Infrastructure Components  
**Estimated Time:** 10-12 hours  
**Dependencies:** Service Layer, Event System, Repository Pattern  

---

## CONTEXT
Create a background job processing system for long-running operations, ETL pipelines, and asynchronous task management. Integrates with the Event System for progress tracking.

## ARCHITECTURAL VISION
Robust background processing:
- Queue-based job processing
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Job scheduling and cron-like functionality
- Progress tracking through events
- Distributed processing capabilities

## DELIVERABLES
1. `src/jobs/Job.ts` - Base job interface
2. `src/jobs/JobQueue.ts` - Job queue management
3. `src/jobs/JobProcessor.ts` - Job execution engine
4. `src/jobs/JobScheduler.ts` - Job scheduling system
5. Integration with Event System for progress tracking

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Job Interface
```typescript
interface Job {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly type: string;
  readonly payload: any;
  readonly priority: number;
  readonly maxRetries: number;
  readonly delay?: number;
  
  execute(): Promise<JobResult>;
  onFailure?(error: Error): Promise<void>;
  onSuccess?(result: any): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 2. Queue Management
- Priority-based job queuing
- Job persistence and recovery
- Dead letter queue for failed jobs
- Rate limiting and throttling

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Jobs can be queued and processed asynchronously
- [ ] Progress is tracked through events
- [ ] Error handling and retry mechanisms work
- [ ] Ready for ETL pipeline integration

## NEXT STEP
After completion, update `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md`:
- Move this task from "In Progress" to "Completed"
- Set **Prompt 15: Monitoring & Diagnostics** to "In Progress"
