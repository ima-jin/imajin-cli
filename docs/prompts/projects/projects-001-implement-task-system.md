# Knowledge-Task Management System

## Context

**Project Status Change**: This is now a **secondary project** since the core CLI generation focus has proven successful with the prompt-based development approach. The current implementation using **docs/prompts/** structure with manual tracking is working well for the **85% completed Phase 1+2 architecture**.

**Current Reality from dev-context.md:**

- ✅ **Phase 1+2 Progress**: Service providers, universal elements, ETL, enterprise patterns mostly complete
- 🔄 **Current Focus**: Business context schema system (Prompt 17.3)
- 📊 **Development Approach**: Prompt-based implementation working effectively
- 🎯 **Primary Goal**: Democratic CLI generation from OpenAPI/GraphQL specs

**Task Management Status:**

- ✅ **Manual Tracking Works**: docs/prompts/README.md tracking 25 prompts effectively
- ✅ **YAML Frontmatter**: Already using structured metadata in prompt files
- ✅ **Git-Based Workflow**: Change tracking through commit history
- ❓ **Automation Value**: Unclear if CLI-based task management adds significant value over current approach

## Project Description

**If implemented after core CLI generation is complete**, this system would provide CLI-based task management that integrates with the imajin-cli architecture for teams that want automated workflow features.

### Potential Value Proposition

1. **CLI Integration**: Task management through imajin-cli commands
2. **Service Integration**: Connect tasks to Stripe, GitHub, Notion workflows
3. **Automation**: Notifications, progress tracking, deadline management
4. **Team Coordination**: Multi-person task assignment and tracking

### **However: Current Manual Approach is Working**

The existing docs/prompts/ structure with YAML frontmatter and manual README tracking has successfully managed 17+ completed prompts without significant friction.

## Deferred Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Validate Need (After Core CLI Complete)

```bash
# Evaluate if manual tracking is limiting productivity
# Survey team on task management pain points
# Assess if existing tools (GitHub Issues, Linear, etc.) are sufficient
```

### Phase 2: CLI Integration Design (If Needed)

```bash
# Design integration with imajin-cli service provider architecture
imajin task:create --title "Add Notion Connector" --project cli-generation
imajin task:assign --id TASK-123 --assignee developer@imajin.cli
imajin task:status --project cli-generation --format table
```

### Phase 3: Service Integration (If High Value)

```bash
# Connect task management to business workflows
imajin task:sync --to github-issues --project cli-generation
imajin task:notify --service slack --webhook $SLACK_WEBHOOK
imajin task:dashboard --export html --publish
```

## Technical Architecture (If Implemented)

### Integration with Current Architecture

```typescript
// Would extend existing Service Provider architecture
export class TaskManagementServiceProvider implements ServiceProvider {
  readonly name = "task-management";
  readonly dependencies = ["credentials", "events", "logging"];

  async register(container: DependencyContainer): Promise<void> {
    // Register task management services
    container.register("TaskService", TaskService);
    container.register("KnowledgeService", KnowledgeService);
    container.register("WorkspaceService", WorkspaceService);
  }
}

// CLI Commands using existing Command Pattern
export class TaskCommands {
  constructor(
    private taskService: TaskService,
    private eventEmitter: EventEmitter
  ) {}

  async createTask(options: TaskOptions): Promise<void> {
    // Create task using universal elements pattern
    const task = await this.taskService.create(options);
    this.eventEmitter.emit("task.created", task);
  }
}
```

### Directory Structure (If Implemented)

```
src/
├── services/
│   └── task-management/           # Task management service
│       ├── TaskService.ts         # Core task operations
│       ├── KnowledgeService.ts    # Knowledge management
│       ├── WorkspaceService.ts    # Workspace coordination
│       └── TaskManagementProvider.ts # Service provider
├── commands/
│   └── task/                      # Task CLI commands
│       ├── TaskCommands.ts        # Task CRUD operations
│       ├── WorkspaceCommands.ts   # Workspace management
│       └── ReportCommands.ts      # Progress reporting
```

## Current Manual Workflow (Working Well)

### Prompt-Based Development Process

1. **Progress Tracking**: docs/prompts/README.md with status tables
2. **Task Definition**: Individual prompt files with YAML frontmatter
3. **Implementation**: Follow prompt requirements exactly
4. **Completion**: Update status from ⏳ Pending → ✅ Complete
5. **Git History**: Natural change tracking through commits

### Success Metrics of Current Approach

- ✅ **17+ Prompts Completed**: Clear progress tracking without automation
- ✅ **Structured Metadata**: YAML frontmatter provides task information
- ✅ **Low Friction**: Manual updates don't slow development
- ✅ **Git Integration**: Natural version control of task status
- ✅ **Team Clarity**: README tables show current status instantly

## Acceptance Criteria (If Project Becomes High Priority)

### Core System

- [ ] **Task Interface**: TypeScript interfaces for Task, Knowledge, Workspace objects
- [ ] **CLI Commands**: Basic CRUD operations through imajin-cli
- [ ] **Markdown Storage**: Tasks stored as .md files with YAML frontmatter
- [ ] **Service Integration**: At least one external service (Slack or GitHub)

### Quality Standards

- [ ] **Architecture Alignment**: Uses Service Provider pattern and Universal Elements
- [ ] **Enterprise Patterns**: Proper error handling, logging, event emission
- [ ] **CLI Integration**: Commands feel native to imajin-cli
- [ ] **Performance**: File operations complete in <100ms

- [[docs/prompts/README.md]] - Current successful manual tracking approach
- [[docs/prompts/phase2/17_3_business_context_schema_system.md]] - Current development priority

## Success Metrics (If Implemented)

1. **Team Adoption**: Task system used for 80%+ of development work
2. **Integration Value**: Service integrations provide clear productivity benefits
3. **Automation Benefits**: Notifications and tracking reduce manual coordination effort
4. **CLI Experience**: Task management feels natural within imajin-cli ecosystem

**Current Recommendation**: **Defer until core CLI generation is complete and proven**. The manual prompt-based approach is working effectively for current team size and development pace. Focus energy on business context recipes and OpenAPI/GraphQL CLI generation instead.

**Future Decision Point**: Reevaluate when:

- Core CLI generation is complete and stable
- Team size grows beyond current manual coordination capacity
- External service integrations become necessary for productivity
- Community contributors need more structured task coordination
