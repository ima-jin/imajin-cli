# Coffee Page Generator

## Context

**Strategic Positioning**: This is the **signature demonstration** of imajin-cli's value proposition - generating complete business applications from business context, not just API wrappers. It showcases the **"Democratic Revolution in API Integration"** by creating professional revenue tools that compete with expensive SaaS platforms.

**Current Foundation Status (from dev-context.md):**

- âœ… **Phase 1+2 Complete**: Service Provider System, Universal Elements, Stripe Connector, Business Context Recipes
- ðŸ”„ **Phase 2 Final**: Business Context Schema System (Prompt 17.3) - nearly complete
- ðŸŽ¯ **Ready For**: Application generation using completed infrastructure

**Market Opportunity:**

- **Ko-fi Alternative**: Creators pay 5-10% platform fees for simple donation pages
- **Gumroad Competition**: 8.5% + $0.30 per transaction for digital products
- **Buy Me a Coffee**: 5% platform fee + payment processing
- **Our Advantage**: Generate professional pages with 0% platform fees, only Stripe's 2.9% + 30Â¢

## Project Description

Build the **first killer application** that demonstrates real business value by generating beautiful, customizable coffee/donation pages with Stripe integration, analytics, and deployment automation.

### Business Value Demonstration

```bash
# Instead of: Paying monthly fees to Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee
# Generate: Professional donation page you own forever

imajin generate coffee-page \
  --business-context creator-monetization \
  --title "Support My Open Source Work" \
  --amounts 5,10,25,50 \
  --domain coffee.yoursite.com \
  --stripe-keys production

# Result: Complete web application with payments, analytics, deployment
# Cost: $0 platform fees (vs 5-10% on existing platforms)
# Ownership: Full control, custom domain, no vendor lock-in
```

### Technical Foundation Leverage

This project utilizes the **completed imajin-cli infrastructure**:

- **Business Context Recipes**: "creator-monetization" template
- **Universal Elements**: Customer, Payment, Transaction mapping
- **Service Provider Architecture**: Modular Stripe integration
- **CLI Generation Engine**: Business-focused commands, not API endpoints
- **Enterprise Patterns**: Error handling, logging, monitoring built-in

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Business Context Integration (Week 1)

```bash
# Leverage completed business context system
imajin init recipe --type creator-monetization
imajin context customize --features donation-pages,analytics,social-sharing

# Generated business context includes:
# - Creator entity (name, bio, social links, goals)
# - Supporter entity (email, donation history, engagement)
# - Donation entity (amount, message, public/private)
# - Revenue analytics and goal tracking
```

### Phase 2: Application Generation (Week 2)

```bash
# Use CLI generation engine to create coffee page commands
imajin generate coffee-page --from-context creator-monetization

# Generated commands:
imajin coffee page:create --title "Support My Work" --amounts 5,10,25,50
imajin coffee page:customize --theme modern-dark --logo ./logo.png
imajin coffee payment:test --amount 10 --currency usd
imajin coffee analytics:revenue --period 30d --export pdf
```

### Phase 3: Professional Features (Week 3)

```bash
# Advanced features leveraging universal elements
imajin coffee supporters:export --format csv --thank-you-email
imajin coffee goals:set --target 1000 --deadline "2025-03-31"
imajin coffee social:share --platforms twitter,linkedin --auto-update

# Deployment using existing infrastructure
imajin coffee deploy:vercel --domain coffee.example.com
imajin coffee deploy:netlify --custom-domain
```

### Phase 4: Revenue Demonstration (Week 4)

```bash
# Analytics and business intelligence
imajin coffee revenue:compare --vs kofi,buymeacoffee --show-savings
imajin coffee metrics:export --for-creators --include-testimonials
imajin coffee case-study:generate --template success-story
```

## Generated Application Architecture

### Business Context Mapping

```typescript
// Leverages Universal Elements system
export interface CreatorMonetizationContext {
  creator: UniversalContact & {
    bio: string;
    socialLinks: SocialPlatform[];
    monetizationGoals: Goal[];
  };

  supporter: UniversalContact & {
    donationHistory: UniversalTransaction[];
    engagementLevel: "one-time" | "recurring" | "super-fan";
  };

  donation: UniversalTransaction & {
    message?: string;
    visibility: "public" | "private";
    tipJar?: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Generated File Structure
