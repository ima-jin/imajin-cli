## üèóÔ∏è **PHASE 1: CORE ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS**

### **PROMPT 1: SERVICE PROVIDER SYSTEM** üîÑ **CURRENT TASK**

```markdown
# üèóÔ∏è IMPLEMENT: Service Provider System

## CONTEXT
Create the foundational Service Provider architecture for imajin-cli that enables modular service registration, dependency management, and clean separation of concerns. This builds directly on the existing TSyringe DI container.

## ARCHITECTURAL VISION
Service Providers act as the "connective layer" between the DI container and business logic:
- Each major system component gets its own ServiceProvider
- Providers handle service registration, initialization, and lifecycle
- Enables hot-swapping and modular architecture
- Foundation for plugin system and service integrations

## DELIVERABLES
Create the following files with proper imajin header templates:

1. `src/core/providers/ServiceProvider.ts` - Base service provider interface
2. `src/core/providers/ServiceProviderManager.ts` - Provider orchestration
3. `src/core/providers/CoreServiceProvider.ts` - Core services provider
4. `src/core/providers/ConfigServiceProvider.ts` - Configuration provider
5. Update `src/core/Application.ts` - Integrate provider system

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Service Provider Interface
```typescript
interface ServiceProvider {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly dependencies: string[];
  
  register(container: DependencyContainer): Promise<void>;
  boot(container: DependencyContainer): Promise<void>;
  shutdown?(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 2. Provider Manager
- Manages provider registration and lifecycle
- Handles dependency resolution between providers  
- Coordinates startup and shutdown sequences
- Error handling for failed providers

### 3. Core Service Provider
- Registers essential services (Logger, Config, etc.)
- Sets up basic application services
- Provides foundation for other providers

## FILE HEADERS

      id: stripeCustomer.id,
      email: stripeCustomer.email || '',
      sourceService: 'stripe',
      serviceData: {
        balance: stripeCustomer.balance,
        delinquent: stripeCustomer.delinquent,

## üéØ **USAGE INSTRUCTIONS**

### **For Each Session:**

1. **Setup Context:**
```bash
# Check current progress
cat docs/DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md

# Find active task and copy corresponding prompt
# Example: Service Provider System = Prompt 1
```

2. **Execute Prompt:**
   - Copy the full prompt for the active task
   - Follow implementation requirements exactly  
   - Create all specified files with proper headers
   - Implement integration points as described

3. **Update Progress:**
```bash
# Move task from "In Progress" to "Completed"
# Update DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md
# Set next task to "In Progress"
```

4. **Validate Completion:**
   - Check all deliverables are created
   - Verify integration points work
   - Run tests if specified
   - Confirm success criteria are met

### **Prompt Customization:**
- Replace `[Author]` with actual author name
- Update dates to current date
