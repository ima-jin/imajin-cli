# üîÑ IMPLEMENT: Cross-service Workflows

**Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING**  
**Phase:** 3 - AI-Enhanced Generation  
**Estimated Time:** 15-18 hours  
**Dependencies:** Workflow Detector, Real-time Progress, LLM Introspection

## CONTEXT
Create workflow orchestration capabilities that enable complex, multi-service operations and automated business processes.

## ARCHITECTURAL VISION
Enterprise workflow automation:
- Multi-service workflow orchestration
- Error handling and compensation patterns
- Business rule enforcement
- Real-time monitoring and control
- Template-based workflow creation

## DELIVERABLES
1. `src/workflows/Workflow.ts` - Workflow definition and execution
2. `src/workflows/WorkflowOrchestrator.ts` - Workflow management
3. `src/workflows/steps/` - Workflow step implementations
4. `src/workflows/compensation/` - Error compensation patterns
5. Integration with all services and ETL pipelines

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Workflow Definition
```typescript
interface Workflow {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  steps: WorkflowStep[];
  compensationSteps: CompensationStep[];
  businessRules: BusinessRule[];
}
```

### 2. Orchestration Features
- Step-by-step execution with rollback
- Conditional branching and loops
- Parallel execution capabilities
- Error handling and recovery

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Multi-service workflows can be defined and executed
- [ ] Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Progress tracking through entire workflows
- [ ] LLM can trigger and monitor workflows

## NEXT STEP
After completion, update `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md`:
- Move this task from "In Progress" to "Completed"
- Set **Prompt 25: Integration Testing** to "In Progress"
