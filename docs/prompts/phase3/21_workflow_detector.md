# üîç IMPLEMENT: Business Workflow Detector

**Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING**  
**Phase:** 3 - AI-Enhanced Generation  
**Estimated Time:** 20-25 hours  
**Dependencies:** AI Context Analysis, Intelligent Generator, Adaptive Optimizer  

---

## CONTEXT
Create an advanced system that discovers, maps, and optimizes real business workflows by analyzing API usage patterns, business documentation, and cross-service integrations to automatically generate sophisticated workflow automation commands.

## ARCHITECTURAL VISION
**Beyond Single-Service Commands:** Detect and automate complex business processes that span multiple services, understand business timing and dependencies, and create intelligent workflow orchestration.

**Cross-Service Intelligence:**
- Multi-service workflow pattern recognition
- Business process timing and dependency mapping
- Intelligent workflow orchestration and error handling
- Cross-platform integration workflow automation
- Business rule extraction and enforcement

## DELIVERABLES
1. `src/workflows/WorkflowDetector.ts` - Cross-service workflow discovery
2. `src/workflows/BusinessProcessMapper.ts` - Business logic flow mapping
3. `src/workflows/CrossServiceOrchestrator.ts` - Multi-service workflow execution
4. `src/workflows/WorkflowTemplateGenerator.ts` - Reusable workflow templates
5. `src/workflows/BusinessRuleEngine.ts` - Workflow business rule enforcement

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Cross-Service Workflow Detection
```typescript
interface WorkflowDetector {
  analyzeMultiServicePatterns(
    services: GeneratedPlugin[],
    usageData: CrossServiceUsage[]
  ): Promise<BusinessWorkflow[]>;
  
  mapBusinessProcesses(
    workflows: BusinessWorkflow[],
    businessContext: BusinessContext
  ): Promise<BusinessProcess[]>;
}
```

### 2. Example Detected Workflows
- E-commerce order fulfillment across multiple services
- SaaS customer onboarding with CRM integration
- Content marketing distribution workflows
- Financial reconciliation processes

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Detects complex multi-service business workflows automatically
- [ ] Generates intelligent workflow orchestration commands
- [ ] Handles cross-service dependencies and error scenarios
- [ ] Creates reusable workflow templates for common business processes
- [ ] Enforces business rules and compliance requirements
