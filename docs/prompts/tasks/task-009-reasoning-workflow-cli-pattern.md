# Reasoning Workflow CLI Pattern - Business Intelligence Context Creation

## Context

With **Task 008 BAML integration complete**, imajin-cli now has AI-powered business analysis capabilities. The next breakthrough is adding **reasoning workflows** to the context creation process - showing users the step-by-step thinking process as business context is analyzed and CLIs are generated.

**Current State**: Business context creation is a "black box" process
**Future State**: Transparent, intelligent reasoning workflows that show business thinking

**Inspiration**: Cursor's reasoning workflows that show step-by-step problem-solving
**Innovation**: Apply this pattern to business CLI generation and context creation

## Task Description

**Add reasoning workflow capabilities to imajin-cli context creation**, transforming CLI generation from a black box into an intelligent business advisor that shows its thinking process.

**Core Philosophy**: Make CLI generation transparent and educational - users learn business thinking while their tools are being built.

### Primary Objectives

1. **Reasoning-Aware Context Creation**: Show step-by-step business analysis thinking
2. **Streaming Business Intelligence**: Real-time reasoning display during context creation
3. **Educational CLI Generation**: Users learn business patterns while tools are generated
4. **Transparent Decision Making**: Clear reasoning behind CLI command suggestions
5. **Interactive Business Consultation**: CLI generation becomes business advisory session

// Core reasoning functions
function ReasonBusinessContext(
    businessDescription: string,
    businessType: string?,
    additionalContext: string?
) -> BusinessReasoningWorkflow {
    client "openai/gpt-4o"
    prompt #"
        I need to analyze this business for CLI generation.
        
        Business Description: {{ businessDescription }}
        {% if businessType %}Suspected Business Type: {{ businessType }}{% endif %}
        {% if additionalContext %}Additional Context: {{ additionalContext }}{% endif %}
        
        Think through this step-by-step like a business consultant:
        
        1. What type of business is this really? (Look beyond surface description)
        2. What are the core business entities and relationships?
        3. What are the key business workflows that need automation?
        4. What are the pain points this business likely faces?
        5. What services would this business typically integrate with?
        6. What CLI commands would actually solve business problems?
        
        Show your reasoning process clearly. Think about:
        - Business model implications
        - Operational workflows
        - Customer journey touchpoints
        - Integration opportunities
        - Automation possibilities
        
        Be specific about WHY you're making each conclusion.
        
        {{ ctx.output_format }}

function ReasonCommandGeneration(
    businessContext: BusinessReasoningWorkflow,
    serviceContext: string,
    existingCommands: string[]
) -> CommandReasoningWorkflow[] {
    client "openai/gpt-4o"
    prompt #"
        Based on this business analysis, reason through CLI command generation:
        
        Business Context: {{ businessContext }}
        Service Context: {{ serviceContext }}
        Existing Commands: {{ existingCommands }}
        
        For each command you suggest, think through:
        1. What business problem does this solve?
        2. When would a user actually need this?
        3. What's the business value?
        4. How does this fit into larger workflows?
        5. What integrations does this enable?
        
        Don't just create CRUD operations - think about business workflows.
        
        Examples of good business reasoning:
        - "customer:onboard" because new customers need multi-service setup
        - "inventory:restock" because stock-outs cost revenue
        - "subscription:pause" because churn prevention is cheaper than acquisition
