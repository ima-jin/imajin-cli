# Documentation Audit & README Refresh

## Context

The imajin-cli project has evolved significantly since initial documentation was created. **Phase 1 (Core Architecture) is complete with 17+ prompts implemented**, and we're actively working through **Phase 2 (Infrastructure Components)** with business context recipes and advanced features emerging.

**Current Implementation Reality (from dev-context.md):**

- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Complete**: Service Provider System, Command Pattern, Universal Elements, Credentials, Events, ETL, Exceptions, Rate Limiting, Media Processing, HTTP/Webhooks, Services, Repository, Background Jobs, Monitoring, Logging
- üîÑ **Phase 2 Active**: Currently on Business Context Schema System (Prompt 17.3)
- üìä **Progress**: ~85% of foundation architecture implemented

**Current Documentation State:**

- üìÑ **Main README.md**: 421 lines, still claims "service provider development" status
- üìÑ **ETL README.md**: 180 lines, technical system documentation (mostly current)
- üìÑ **Prompts README.md**: 249 lines, shows current implementation tracking
- üìÑ **Stripe Service README.md**: 262 lines, reference implementation docs (current)
- üìÑ **AI Context Files**: dev-context.md and project-context.md are current

**Critical Documentation Misalignments:**

1. **Status Claims**: Main README says "service provider development" but we're 85% through Phase 1+2
2. **Narrative Evolution**: Original "anti-middleware" focus vs. current "democratic CLI generation" with business recipes
3. **Missing Systems**: No documentation for business context recipes, universal graph translation, or recent architectural additions
4. **User Journey Gaps**: No clear path from discovery ‚Üí business setup ‚Üí CLI generation ‚Üí advanced usage
5. **Technical Accuracy**: Architecture descriptions don't match current modular service provider implementation

## Task Description

Align documentation with **current implementation reality** and evolve narrative to match the **"Democratic Revolution in API Integration"** vision from project-context.md.

**Cross-Task Coordination**: This task should align with Task 002 (Business Plan Generation) to ensure consistent messaging about market positioning, competitive advantages, and fair attribution model throughout all documentation.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Implementation Reality Audit (Days 1-2)

#### **Codebase Verification**

```bash
# Verify actual implementation status
find src/ -name "*.ts" | head -20  # Check actual file structure
grep -r "ServiceProvider" src/ | wc -l  # Verify service provider system
grep -r "UniversalElement" src/ | wc -l  # Verify universal elements
find docs/prompts/phase*/ -name "*.md" | wc -l  # Count completed prompts
```

#### **Documentation Claims vs. Reality**

- Map README claims against actual TypeScript source files
- Identify features described but not yet implemented
- Note completed systems missing from documentation
- Document architectural patterns actually in use

#### **User Journey Mapping**

```
Current Documented Flow: README ‚Üí ? ‚Üí Generic API Usage
Actual Current Flow: Business Context ‚Üí Recipe Selection ‚Üí CLI Generation
Desired Documentation Flow: Problem ‚Üí Demo ‚Üí Setup ‚Üí Business Context ‚Üí Generated CLIs
```

### Phase 2: Narrative & Architecture Refresh (Days 3-4)

#### **Main README Structure (New)**

```markdown
