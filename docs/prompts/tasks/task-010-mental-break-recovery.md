# Mental Break Recovery & Status Onboarding

## Context

Development projects with complex architectures like imajin-cli require **mental context preservation** across work sessions. After breaks (days, weeks, or months), developers need a **systematic approach** to rebuild mental state and understand current project reality.

**Current Project Reality (January 2025):**

- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Foundation Architecture (100% - all 6 prompts)
- 🔄 **Phase 2 Active**: Infrastructure Components (85% - 17/19 prompts complete)
- 📋 **Active Tasks**: TASK-001 through TASK-009 with various completion states
- 🏗️ **Architecture Status**: Multi-service orchestration system with business context recipes

**Mental Break Recovery Challenges:**

1. **Context Loss**: Forgetting what was "in progress" vs "completed"
2. **Priority Confusion**: Which tasks should be tackled next?
3. **Architecture Drift**: Understanding how recent changes affect the big picture
4. **Task Dependencies**: Which tasks are blocked/blocking others?
5. **Testing Reality**: What actually works vs what's documented?

## Task Description

Create a **systematic mental break recovery process** that helps developers (including the original author) quickly rebuild project context and resume productive work.

### Core Recovery Workflow

**Phase 1: Quick Status Assessment (5-10 minutes)**
```bash
# 1. Git status check
git status
git log --oneline -10

# 2. Build status verification
npm run build
npm test

# 3. Core functionality check
imajin --version
imajin generate --help
```

**Phase 2: Context Reconstruction (15-20 minutes)**
- [ ] Review current task priorities from README progress tracking
- [ ] Check `docs/_context/ARCHITECTURE.md` for latest architectural decisions
- [ ] Scan `docs/prompts/tasks/` for any new/modified tasks
- [ ] Review recent commits for implementation changes

**Phase 3: Mental Model Refresh (10-15 minutes)**
- [ ] Read business context examples in `docs/_context/WORKING_EXAMPLES.md`
- [ ] Test core CLI generation: `imajin generate stripe --spec https://api.stripe.com/openapi.json`
- [ ] Review latest task dependencies and blocking issues

### Recovery Deliverables

**1. Status Dashboard Creation**
```markdown
# PROJECT_STATUS.md (Generated)
## Last Recovery: [DATE]

### Phase Completion
- Phase 1: ✅ 100% Complete
- Phase 2: 🔄 85% Complete (17/19 prompts)

### Active Tasks
- TASK-XXX: [Status] - [Next Action]
- TASK-YYY: [Status] - [Dependencies]

### Immediate Priorities
1. [Next most important task]
2. [Any blocking issues]
3. [Quick wins available]

### Testing Status
- Core CLI: ✅ Working
- Stripe Generation: ✅ Working  
- Business Context: 🔄 Testing needed

### Notes from Recovery Session
- [What surprised you]
- [What needs immediate attention]
- [Questions that arose]
```

**2. Next Session Preparation**
- [ ] Create/update personal TODO list for next session
- [ ] Identify any knowledge gaps that emerged during recovery
- [ ] Update project documentation if gaps found
- [ ] Set up development environment for immediate productivity

### Recovery Tools & Checklists

**Quick Context Files** (bookmark these):
- `README.md` - Current phase status and progress tracking
- `docs/_context/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Latest architectural decisions
- `docs/_guides/GETTING_STARTED.md` - Development workflow reminders
- `docs/prompts/README.md` - Prompt completion status
- Latest task files in `docs/prompts/tasks/` directory

**Testing Verification Commands**:
```bash
# Verify CLI works
imajin --version

# Test core generation
imajin generate test-stripe --spec https://api.stripe.com/openapi.json

# Check business context processing
ls src/business-context/recipes/

# Verify service providers
ls src/services/*/

# Check for any failing tests
npm test 2>&1 | grep -E "FAIL|Error"
```

**Mental Model Reconstruction Questions**:
1. What's the current "elevator pitch" for what imajin-cli does?
2. What's the last major feature that was completed?
3. What problem is the current active task solving?
4. How does the business context system work now?
5. What services can we generate CLIs for currently?

### Advanced Recovery Strategies

**For Extended Breaks (1+ months):**
- [ ] Read commit messages since last session: `git log --since="1 month ago" --oneline`
- [ ] Review any new documentation files
- [ ] Check for dependency updates that might affect understanding
- [ ] Test generation against multiple services to verify current capabilities

**For Team Recovery (multiple people):**
- [ ] Review shared context in `docs/_context/` files
- [ ] Check if anyone else has been working (git blame recent files)
- [ ] Update task assignments if team structure changed
- [ ] Sync understanding of current priorities

**For Architecture-Heavy Sessions:**
- [ ] Re-read `docs/_context/ARCHITECTURE.md` thoroughly
- [ ] Trace through one complete CLI generation example
- [ ] Understand how Universal Elements currently work
- [ ] Review business context recipe system status

## Success Criteria

**Immediate Success (30-45 minutes):**
- [ ] Clear understanding of current project phase and completion status
- [ ] Ability to generate a working CLI from an OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Knowledge of what task to work on next
- [ ] Confidence in development environment setup

**Session Success (end of work session):**
- [ ] Productive work accomplished on identified priorities
- [ ] Any discovered gaps documented for future recovery
- [ ] Next session prepared with clear starting point
- [ ] Project context preserved for future breaks

**Long-term Success:**
- [ ] Consistent recovery process reduces "getting back up to speed" time
- [ ] Documentation stays current with recovery process use
- [ ] Recovery process catches project drift and architectural changes
- [ ] Other team members can use same process successfully

## Implementation Notes

**File Organization:**
- This task document serves as the recovery template
- Individual recovery sessions should create temporary `PROJECT_STATUS.md` files
- Personal TODO lists can be kept in workspace-specific locations
- Consider automation for status dashboard generation

**Integration with Existing Tasks:**
- Recovery should reference current tasks (TASK-001 through TASK-009)
- Update other task documentation if recovery reveals gaps
- Use recovery sessions to validate that task documentation matches reality

**Continuous Improvement:**
- Note what information was missing during recovery
- Update this task document based on what actually helps
- Share recovery process improvements with team
- Automate repetitive recovery steps where possible

**Dependencies**: None (foundational task)
**Enables**: More effective resumption of work on TASK-001 through TASK-009
**Maintenance**: Update this task whenever major project structure changes occur
