# Market Research Data Sourcing & Citation Verification

## Context

The comprehensive business plan suite generated in TASK-002 currently contains fabricated market statistics and survey data that could destroy credibility during investor due diligence. All made-up citations have been removed and replaced with general statements, but the business plan needs real, verifiable data to support investment decisions.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Business plan documents generated and structurally complete
- ‚úÖ Fabricated citations removed to prevent credibility damage
- ‚ùå Missing credible market research data for key business arguments
- ‚ùå No verifiable statistics supporting market opportunity claims

**Critical Need:**
Professional business plans require credible data sources that can withstand investor fact-checking. This task will source real market research to strengthen the investment thesis with verifiable statistics.

## Task Description

Research and source credible market data to replace placeholder statements in the business plan documents with verifiable statistics from reputable sources (Gartner, IDC, Stack Overflow, GitHub, etc.).
