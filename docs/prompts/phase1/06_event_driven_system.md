# üöÄ IMPLEMENT: Event-Driven System

**Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING**  
**Phase:** 1 - Core Architecture Patterns  
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours  
**Dependencies:** Service Providers, Command Pattern  

---

## CONTEXT
Create a comprehensive event-driven architecture for imajin-cli that enables real-time communication, progress tracking, and loose coupling between components. This builds on Service Providers and Command Pattern.

## ARCHITECTURAL VISION
Events enable loose coupling and real-time communication:
- Components communicate through events rather than direct calls
- Real-time progress tracking for CLI operations
- Foundation for LLM communication and monitoring
- Integration with plugin system for event-driven workflows

## DELIVERABLES
1. `src/core/events/Event.ts` - Base event interface and types
2. `src/core/events/EventEmitter.ts` - Enhanced event emitter
3. `src/core/events/EventManager.ts` - Event registration and coordination
4. `src/core/events/EventServiceProvider.ts` - Event system provider
5. Integration with Command Pattern for event-driven commands

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Event System Foundation
- Type-safe event definitions
- Event metadata and serialization
- Event versioning and backward compatibility
- Integration with Node.js EventEmitter

### 2. Event Management
- Event listener registration and lifecycle
- Event middleware pipeline
- Error handling and dead letter queues
- Performance monitoring and metrics

### 3. Integration Points
- Commands can emit events during execution
- Plugins can subscribe to system events
- Foundation for real-time progress tracking
- Preparation for LLM communication

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Events can be emitted and consumed reliably
- [ ] Real-time updates work for CLI operations
- [ ] Plugin system can use events for communication
- [ ] Foundation ready for background jobs and monitoring

## NEXT STEP
After completion, update `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md`:
- Move this task from "In Progress" to "Completed"
- Set **Prompt 7: ETL Pipeline System** to "In Progress"
