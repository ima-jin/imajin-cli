# üèóÔ∏è IMPLEMENT: Service Provider System

**Status:** ‚è≥ **COMPLETE**  
**Phase:** 1 - Core Architecture Patterns  
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Dependencies:** None (Foundation)

---

## CONTEXT

Create the foundational Service Provider architecture for imajin-cli that enables modular service registration, dependency management, and clean separation of concerns. This builds directly on the existing TSyringe DI container.

## ARCHITECTURAL VISION

Service Providers act as the "connective layer" between the DI container and business logic:

- Each major system component gets its own ServiceProvider
- Providers handle service registration, initialization, and lifecycle
- Enables hot-swapping and modular architecture
- Foundation for plugin system and service integrations

## DELIVERABLES

Create the following files with proper imajin header templates:

1. `src/core/providers/ServiceProvider.ts` - Base service provider interface
2. `src/core/providers/ServiceProviderManager.ts` - Provider orchestration
3. `src/core/providers/CoreServiceProvider.ts` - Core services provider
4. `src/core/providers/ConfigServiceProvider.ts` - Configuration provider
5. Update `src/core/Application.ts` - Integrate provider system

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Service Provider Interface

```typescript
interface ServiceProvider {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly dependencies: string[];

  register(container: DependencyContainer): Promise<void>;
  boot(container: DependencyContainer): Promise<void>;
  shutdown?(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 2. Provider Manager

- Manages provider registration and lifecycle
- Handles dependency resolution between providers
- Coordinates startup and shutdown sequences
- Error handling for failed providers

### 3. Core Service Provider

- Registers essential services (Logger, Config, etc.)
- Sets up basic application services
- Provides foundation for other providers

## FILE HEADERS

Use the imajin TypeScript header template for all files:

```typescript
/**
 * [ClassName] - [Brief Description]
 *
 * @package     @imajin/cli
 * @subpackage  core/providers
 * @author      Generated
 * @copyright   imajin
 * @license     .fair LICENSING AGREEMENT
 * @version     0.1.0
 * @since       2025-06-09
 *
 * Integration Points:
 * - TSyringe DI container integration
 * - Application lifecycle management
 * - Service registration and bootstrapping
 */
```

## INTEGRATION POINTS

- Must work with existing TSyringe DI container
- Should enable easy service registration for future components
- Prepare for Command Pattern, Event System, and Service Layer
- Support for lazy loading and conditional service registration

## TESTING REQUIREMENTS

Create tests for:

- ServiceProvider registration and boot lifecycle
- ServiceProviderManager coordination
- Error handling for failed providers
- Integration with Application class

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] Service providers can be registered and booted reliably
- [ ] Application.ts uses provider system for initialization
- [ ] Foundation ready for Command Pattern and other systems
- [ ] Clean separation between registration and business logic
- [ ] Ready for plugin system integration
