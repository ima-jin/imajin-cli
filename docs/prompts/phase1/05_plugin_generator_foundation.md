# ü§ñ IMPLEMENT: Plugin Generator Foundation

**Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING**  
**Phase:** 1 - Core Architecture Patterns  
**Estimated Time:** 10-12 hours  
**Dependencies:** Service Providers, Command Pattern, Type System, Credentials

---

## CONTEXT

Create a basic Plugin Generator system that can create simple CLI plugins from OpenAPI specifications. This is the FOUNDATION version - focused on core functionality without advanced features like auto-healing.

## ARCHITECTURAL VISION

Start simple and build up:

- OpenAPI spec ‚Üí Basic CLI plugin with CRUD operations
- Generated plugins use the Command Pattern framework
- Plugins integrate with Credential Management system
- Foundation for future auto-healing and advanced features

## DELIVERABLES

1. `src/generators/PluginGenerator.ts` - Core plugin generation
2. `src/generators/OpenAPIParser.ts` - OpenAPI spec parsing
3. `src/generators/templates/` - Basic code generation templates
4. `src/core/PluginManager.ts` - Plugin loading and management
5. Generated plugin example (for validation)

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Plugin Generator (Basic Version)

```typescript
interface PluginGenerator {
  generateFromOpenAPI(spec: OpenAPISpec): Promise<GeneratedPlugin>;
  validateSpec(spec: OpenAPISpec): ValidationResult;
  createPluginFiles(plugin: GeneratedPlugin): Promise<string[]>;
}
```

### 2. Generated Plugin Structure (Simplified)

```typescript
interface GeneratedPlugin {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  commands: CommandDefinition[];
  authType: "api-key" | "oauth2" | "bearer";
  files: PluginFile[];
}
```

### 3. Basic Templates

- Simple command class template
- Basic authentication handling
- Standard error handling (no auto-healing yet)
- TypeScript interfaces from OpenAPI schemas

### 4. Integration Requirements

- Generated plugins must work with Command Pattern framework
- Must integrate with Credential Management system
- Should be loadable through Plugin Manager
- Prepare structure for future auto-healing features

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] Can generate a working plugin from Stripe OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Generated plugin integrates with existing command system
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations work (create, read, update, delete)
- [ ] Authentication works with credential management
- [ ] Foundation ready for advanced features in later phases
