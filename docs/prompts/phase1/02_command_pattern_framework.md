# ‚ö° IMPLEMENT: Command Pattern Framework

**Status:** ‚è≥ **COMPLETE**  
**Phase:** 1 - Core Architecture Patterns  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Dependencies:** Service Provider System (Prompt 1)

---

## CONTEXT

Create a comprehensive Command Pattern framework for imajin-cli that enables modular command registration, execution, and management. This builds on the Service Provider system.

## ARCHITECTURAL VISION

Commands are the primary interaction interface:

- Each CLI command maps to a Command class
- Commands are registered through service providers
- Supports nested command groups and complex arguments
- Foundation for plugin-generated commands

## DELIVERABLES

1. `src/core/commands/Command.ts` - Base command interface
2. `src/core/commands/CommandManager.ts` - Command registration and execution
3. `src/core/commands/CommandServiceProvider.ts` - Command system provider
4. `src/commands/` - Directory for core commands
5. Update existing Application.ts - Integrate command system

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Command Interface

```typescript
interface Command {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly description: string;
  readonly arguments: ArgumentDefinition[];
  readonly options: OptionDefinition[];

  execute(args: any[], options: any): Promise<CommandResult>;
  validate?(args: any[], options: any): ValidationResult;
}
```

### 2. Command Manager

- Dynamic command registration through providers
- Command discovery and help system
- Argument parsing and validation
- Error handling and user feedback

### 3. Integration Points

- Must work with Service Provider system
- Should support plugin-generated commands
- Prepare for credential management integration
- Foundation for service-specific command groups

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] Commands can be registered dynamically through service providers
- [ ] CLI supports nested command groups and help system
- [ ] Arguments and options are properly validated
- [ ] Ready for plugin-generated command integration
- [ ] Foundation prepared for service connectors

## NEXT STEP

After completion, update `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md`:

- Move this task from "In Progress" to "Completed"
- Set **Prompt 3: Type Collision Prevention System** to "In Progress"
